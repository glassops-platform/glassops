## Lightning Web Component (LWC) Adapter Documentation

**Introduction**

This document details the functionality of the LWC Adapter, a component designed to process Lightning Web Component files and prepare them for documentation generation. It is part of a larger system for automatically creating documentation from source code.

**Purpose**

The LWC Adapter identifies, parses, and formats LWC files (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) into a structured bundle suitable for input to a language model. This allows for automated documentation of LWC components.

**Functionality**

The adapter operates through a series of defined steps: file identification, content parsing, prompt generation, and post-processing.

**1. File Identification (`canHandle`)**

The adapter determines if a given file should be processed based on its name and extension. Specifically, it checks:

*   The file extension is `.js`.
*   The file name or path includes “lwc” or “lwc/”.

This ensures that only JavaScript files associated with LWC components are considered.

**2. Content Parsing (`parse`)**

If a file is identified as an LWC component, the `parse` function extracts and combines the component’s code:

*   It locates potential sibling HTML and CSS files based on the JavaScript file’s name.
*   It reads the content of the JavaScript, HTML (if found), and CSS (if found) files.
*   It constructs a bundled string containing the content of each file, clearly labeled as “Controller (JS)”, “Template (HTML)”, and “Styles (CSS)”.
*   If the component does not have associated HTML or CSS files, only the JavaScript content is included in the bundle.

The function returns an array containing the bundled string.

**3. Prompt Generation (`generatePrompt`)**

The `generatePrompt` function creates a prompt designed for a language model. This prompt instructs the model to act as a Salesforce Developer Expert and generate documentation for the provided LWC. The prompt includes the bundled content from the `parse` function.

**4. Post-Processing (`postProcess`)**

The `postProcess` function combines multiple outputs (generated by the language model) into a single string, separated by double newlines. This ensures a clean and readable final documentation output.

**Internal Methods**

*   `exists(p: string)`: Asynchronously checks if a file exists at the given path. Returns `true` if the file exists, `false` otherwise. This method handles potential file system errors gracefully.

**Example**

Consider a component with the following files:

*   `myComponent.js`
*   `myComponent.html`
*   `myComponent.css`

The `parse` function would produce a bundle similar to this:

```
File: myComponent.js

Controller (JS):
```javascript
// Component JavaScript code
```

```
Template (HTML):
```html
// Component HTML code
```

```
Styles (CSS):
```css
// Component CSS code
```

This bundle would then be passed to the `generatePrompt` function to create the prompt for the language model.

**Dependencies**

*   `fs/promises`: For asynchronous file system operations.
*   `path`: For manipulating file paths.

**Interfaces**

*   `AgentAdapter`: This adapter implements the `AgentAdapter` interface, ensuring compatibility with the broader documentation generation system.
