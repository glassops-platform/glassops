## Lightning Web Component (LWC) Adapter Documentation

**Overview**

This adapter processes Lightning Web Component files within a Salesforce project to generate documentation. It identifies LWC JavaScript files and, if available, incorporates associated HTML and CSS files into a single documentation bundle. This comprehensive approach provides a complete view of each component for improved understanding and maintainability.

**Functionality**

The LWC Adapter functions through four primary stages: file handling, parsing, prompt generation, and post-processing.

**1. File Handling (canHandle)**

The adapter determines if a file should be processed based on its name and extension. Specifically, it targets JavaScript files (`.js`) that are part of a Lightning Web Component – identified by either containing “lwc” in the file path or residing within an “lwc” directory. This filtering prevents processing of non-LWC JavaScript files and avoids redundant documentation of component parts.

**2. Parsing (parse)**

Upon identifying an LWC JavaScript file, the adapter attempts to locate corresponding HTML and CSS files with the same base name. It then reads the content of these files, if they exist, and combines them into a single string bundle. The bundle includes the JavaScript controller, HTML template, and CSS styles, each clearly delineated with appropriate headers. If HTML or CSS files are not found, they are omitted from the bundle.

**3. Prompt Generation (generatePrompt)**

The adapter constructs a prompt designed for a large language model. This prompt instructs the model to act as a Salesforce Developer Expert and generate documentation for the provided LWC bundle. The prompt specifically requests a description of the component’s purpose, public properties (using `@api`), events, and user interface behavior.

**4. Post-Processing (postProcess)**

The adapter combines multiple outputs from the language model into a single, formatted string, separated by double newlines, for clarity and readability.

**Dependencies**

*   Node.js `fs/promises` module for asynchronous file system operations.
*   Node.js `path` module for path manipulation.

**Configuration**

You do not need to directly configure this adapter. It automatically detects LWC files based on naming conventions and directory structure.

**Usage**

This adapter is intended for use within a larger documentation generation pipeline. It automatically processes eligible files based on the criteria defined in the `canHandle` method. The resulting documentation is generated by the language model based on the prompt created by the `generatePrompt` method.
