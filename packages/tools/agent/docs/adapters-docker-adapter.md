## Docker Adapter Documentation

**1. Introduction**

This document details the functionality of the Docker Adapter, a component designed to integrate Dockerfile processing into a larger agent system. The adapter’s purpose is to identify, parse, and prepare Dockerfile content for analysis and documentation generation.

**2. Core Functionality**

The Docker Adapter operates through four primary functions: `canHandle`, `parse`, `generatePrompt`, and `postProcess`. These functions work together to process Dockerfile content and prepare it for further action.

**3. Detailed Function Descriptions**

* **`canHandle(fileName: string): boolean`**: This function determines if the adapter should process a given file. It checks if the file name (case-insensitive) ends with “dockerfile”. If it does, the function returns `true`, indicating the adapter can handle the file. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

* **`parse(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<string[]>`**: This function takes the file path and content of a Dockerfile as input. It formats the content into a string array suitable for prompt generation. The output includes the file path and the Dockerfile content enclosed in a code block.

* **`generatePrompt(filePath: string, parsedContent: string): string`**: This function constructs a prompt for a language model. The prompt instructs the model to act as a DevOps Engineer and generate documentation for the provided Dockerfile content. The prompt includes the parsed Dockerfile content.

* **`postProcess(filePath: string, outputs: string[]): string`**: This function takes the outputs generated by the language model (an array of strings) and combines them into a single string, separated by double newlines. This creates a more readable and organized final output.

**4. Workflow**

The typical workflow for the Docker Adapter is as follows:

1.  The system identifies a file.
2.  `canHandle` is called to determine if the adapter should process the file.
3.  If `canHandle` returns `true`, `parse` is called to format the file content.
4.  `generatePrompt` is called to create a prompt for a language model, using the parsed content.
5.  The language model processes the prompt and generates documentation.
6.  `postProcess` is called to format the language model’s output into a final, readable string.

**5. Configuration**

Currently, the Docker Adapter does not require any external configuration. Its behavior is determined solely by the file name and content it receives. 

**6. Dependencies**

The adapter relies on the following dependencies:

*   `path`: A Node.js module for working with file paths.
*   `./interface.js`: Defines the `AgentAdapter` interface that this adapter implements.

**7. Future Considerations**

Potential future enhancements include:

*   Adding support for multi-stage Dockerfiles with more detailed analysis.
*   Implementing validation of Dockerfile syntax.
*   Providing options for customizing the prompt sent to the language model.
