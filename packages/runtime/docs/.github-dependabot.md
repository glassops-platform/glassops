# Dependabot Configuration Documentation

This document details the configuration for Dependabot, a tool for automatically keeping project dependencies up to date. This configuration is located at `packages/runtime/.github/dependabot.yml`.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this configuration is to automate dependency updates for both npm packages and GitHub Actions used within the `packages/runtime` project.  Dependabot will periodically check for new versions of these dependencies and create pull requests to update them. This helps maintain security and benefit from bug fixes and new features in those dependencies.

## Structure

The configuration file is structured using YAML and consists of a top-level `version` key and an `updates` key. The `updates` key contains a list of update configurations, each defining how Dependabot should handle a specific package ecosystem.

## Key Breakdown

### `version: 2`

*   **Purpose:** Specifies the version of the Dependabot configuration format. Version 2 is the latest and recommended version.

### `updates:`

*   **Purpose:**  A list containing individual update configurations for different package ecosystems. Each item in this list represents a separate set of rules for updating dependencies.

#### Update Configuration (npm)

*   **`package-ecosystem: "npm"`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Specifies that this configuration applies to npm (Node Package Manager) dependencies.
*   **`directory: "/"`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Defines the root directory to scan for `package.json` files. A value of `"/"` indicates the project root.
*   **`schedule:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Controls the frequency of dependency updates.
        *   **`interval: "weekly"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Sets the update interval to weekly.
        *   **`day: "monday"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Specifies that updates should be checked for and pull requests created on Mondays.
*   **`open-pull-requests-limit: 10`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Limits the number of open pull requests Dependabot will create for npm dependencies to 10. This prevents overwhelming the repository with update requests.
*   **`ignore:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Defines dependencies or versions to be ignored by Dependabot.
        *   **`dependency-name: "eslint"`**
            *   **Purpose:** Specifies the dependency to ignore.
        *   **`versions: [">= 9.0.0"]`**
            *   **Purpose:** Specifies the versions of the dependency to ignore. In this case, any version of ESLint 9.0.0 or higher is ignored due to a breaking change requiring a configuration migration.
*   **`labels:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Adds labels to the pull requests created by Dependabot.
        *   **`- "dependencies"`**
            *   **Purpose:** Adds the "dependencies" label.
        *   **`- "npm"`**
            *   **Purpose:** Adds the "npm" label.
*   **`commit-message:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Customizes the commit message for pull requests.
        *   **`prefix: "chore(deps)"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Sets the prefix for the commit message to "chore(deps)", indicating a dependency-related change.

#### Update Configuration (GitHub Actions)

*   **`package-ecosystem: "github-actions"`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Specifies that this configuration applies to GitHub Actions dependencies (workflows, actions, etc.).
*   **`directory: "/"`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Defines the root directory to scan for GitHub Actions workflows. A value of `"/"` indicates the project root.
*   **`schedule:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Controls the frequency of dependency updates.
        *   **`interval: "weekly"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Sets the update interval to weekly.
        *   **`day: "monday"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Specifies that updates should be checked for and pull requests created on Mondays.
*   **`open-pull-requests-limit: 5`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Limits the number of open pull requests Dependabot will create for GitHub Actions dependencies to 5.
*   **`labels:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Adds labels to the pull requests created by Dependabot.
        *   **`- "dependencies"`**
            *   **Purpose:** Adds the "dependencies" label.
        *   **`- "github-actions"`**
            *   **Purpose:** Adds the "github-actions" label.
*   **`commit-message:`**
    *   **Purpose:**  Customizes the commit message for pull requests.
        *   **`prefix: "chore(ci)"`**
            *   **Purpose:**  Sets the prefix for the commit message to "chore(ci)", indicating a CI-related change.
