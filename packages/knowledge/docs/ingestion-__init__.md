## Knowledge Ingestion Package Documentation

This document describes the purpose and functionality of the knowledge ingestion package. This package provides tools for bringing external data sources into a system for use by applications like question answering or information retrieval. It focuses on automating the process of finding documents, preparing them for processing, and making them searchable.

**Module Responsibilities:**

The primary responsibility of this package is to handle the initial stages of knowledge integration. This includes locating relevant documents from various sources, dividing those documents into manageable chunks, and constructing an index that allows for efficient searching. It abstracts away the complexities of data source connectivity and document formatting.

**Key Components:**

The package exposes two main functions: `discover_and_chunk_docs` and `build_or_update_index`.

*   **`discover_and_chunk_docs`**: This function is the entry point for locating and preparing documents. It automatically searches for documents based on configured sources (details of source configuration are external to this package). Once found, it divides these documents into smaller, more manageable chunks. These chunks are then returned as a list. The function’s design supports handling diverse document types and formats.

*   **`build_or_update_index`**: This function takes the chunks generated by `discover_and_chunk_docs` and uses them to create or update a search index. This index is the core component that enables fast and accurate information retrieval. If an index already exists, this function intelligently updates it with the new chunks, avoiding redundant processing.

**Type Hints:**

Both functions employ type hints to improve code clarity and maintainability. While the specific type signatures are internal to the function implementations, their presence ensures that data is handled consistently and helps prevent errors during development. For example, `discover_and_chunk_docs` will return a list of document chunks, and `build_or_update_index` expects a list of these chunks as input.

**Design Decisions and Patterns:**

The package follows a clear separation of concerns. Document discovery and chunking are handled by one function, while index creation and updating are handled by another. This modular design makes the package more flexible and easier to extend. The `build_or_update_index` function’s ability to both create and update an index simplifies the overall workflow.

**Usage:**

You would typically use these functions in sequence. First, you call `discover_and_chunk_docs` to locate and prepare your documents. Then, you pass the resulting chunks to `build_or_update_index` to create or update the search index. This index can then be used by other components of your system to answer questions or retrieve information.
