## Knowledge Ingestion Package Documentation

This document describes the purpose and functionality of the knowledge ingestion package. This package provides tools for bringing external data sources into a system for use by applications like question answering or information retrieval. It focuses on automating the process of finding documents, preparing them for processing, and making them searchable.

**Module Responsibilities:**

The primary responsibility of this package is to handle the initial stages of knowledge integration. This includes locating relevant documents from various sources, dividing those documents into manageable chunks, and constructing an index that allows for efficient searching. It abstracts away the complexities of data source connectivity and document formatting.

**Key Components:**

The package exposes two main functions: `discover_and_chunk_docs` and `build_or_update_index`.

* **`discover_and_chunk_docs`**: This function is the entry point for locating and preparing documents. It automatically searches for documents based on configured sources (details of source configuration are external to this package). Once found, it divides these documents into smaller, more manageable chunks. These chunks are then returned as a list. The function’s design supports handling diverse document types and formats.

* **`build_or_update_index`**: This function takes the document chunks generated by `discover_and_chunk_docs` and constructs or updates a search index. This index allows for rapid retrieval of relevant information. If an index already exists, it is updated with the new chunks; otherwise, a new index is created. The function handles the technical details of index creation and maintenance.

**Type Hints:**

Both functions employ type hints to improve code clarity and maintainability. While the specific type hints are internal to the function implementations, their presence indicates a commitment to well-defined interfaces and data structures. This aids in debugging and allows for static analysis to catch potential errors.

**Design Patterns and Decisions:**

The package follows a clear separation of concerns. Document discovery and chunking are distinct from index building. This modular design allows for flexibility and easier maintenance. You can, for example, swap out different indexing technologies without affecting the document loading process. The `__all__` variable explicitly defines the public API of the package, controlling what is exposed to external users and preventing accidental reliance on internal implementation details. We aim to provide a simple and focused interface for knowledge ingestion.
