## Knowledge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Package Documentation

**Overview:**

This package provides functionality for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) – a technique that combines information retrieval with generative models to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses. Specifically, it enables querying a knowledge index to retrieve relevant context, which is then used to inform the generation of an answer.

**Key Components:**

*   **`query_index` Function:** This is the primary entry point for the RAG functionality. It accepts a query string as input and returns a response generated by leveraging retrieved information from a pre-built knowledge index.  The underlying implementation handles the retrieval of relevant documents and their integration with a language model to produce the final output.

**Usage:**

To utilize the RAG functionality, import the `query_index` function:

```python
from knowledge.rag import query_index

response = query_index("Your query here")
print(response)
```

**Dependencies:**

This package relies on a pre-existing knowledge index. Details regarding the creation and maintenance of this index are documented separately.  The `query_index` function assumes the index is accessible and properly configured.

**Technical Details:**

The `query_index` function encapsulates the core RAG pipeline.  It internally manages the following steps:

1.  **Retrieval:**  Identifies relevant documents from the knowledge index based on the input query.
2.  **Contextualization:**  Combines the retrieved documents with the original query to create a contextual prompt.
3.  **Generation:**  Utilizes a language model to generate a response based on the contextual prompt.

**`__all__` Declaration:**

The `__all__` list explicitly defines the public interface of the `knowledge.rag` package, ensuring that only the `query_index` function is directly accessible when importing the package using `from knowledge.rag import *`. This promotes code clarity and maintainability.
