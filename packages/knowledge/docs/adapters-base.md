# Documentation Generation Adapters: Base Class

This document describes the base adapter interface for documentation generation within the system. It defines the core components and methods required for integrating different language-specific documentation tools. The primary responsibility of these adapters is to bridge the gap between source code files and the large language model (LLM) used for documentation creation.

## Core Concepts

The system employs an adapter pattern to support various programming languages and documentation styles. Each adapter encapsulates the logic for parsing, prompting, and post-processing documentation for a specific language. This design promotes extensibility and maintainability.

## BaseAdapter Class

The `BaseAdapter` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the interface all language adapters must implement. It ensures consistency across different language implementations.

**Attributes:**

This class does not have any attributes. Its functionality is entirely defined by its methods.

**Methods:**

*   `can_handle(file_path: Path) -> bool`: This abstract method determines whether the adapter can process a given file based on its path. You must implement this to specify which file types your adapter supports. It accepts a `Path` object representing the file's location and returns `True` if the adapter can handle the file, and `False` otherwise.

*   `parse(file_path: Path, content: str) -> List[str]`: This abstract method parses the content of a source file and divides it into smaller chunks suitable for processing by the LLM. It takes the file path (`Path`) and the raw file content (`str`) as input. The method returns a list of strings, where each string represents a single chunk of content.

*   `get_prompt(file_path: Path, parsed_content: str) -> str`: This abstract method generates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM for documentation generation. It receives the file path (`Path`) and a single chunk of parsed content (`str`) as input. The method returns a string containing the prompt.

*   `post_process(file_path: Path, outputs: List[str]) -> str`: This method combines the outputs generated by the LLM for each chunk of content into a single, final documentation string. It takes the file path (`Path`) and a list of LLM outputs (`List[str]`) as input. The default implementation simply joins the outputs with double newlines (`\n\n`). You can override this method in derived classes to implement custom post-processing logic.

## Type Hints

The code extensively uses type hints (e.g., `file_path: Path`, `content: str`, `-> bool`). These hints improve code readability and allow for static analysis, helping to catch potential errors during development. The `Path` type from the `pathlib` module is used to represent file paths in a platform-independent manner. `List[str]` indicates a list containing strings.

## Design Considerations

The adapter pattern allows for easy addition of support for new languages without modifying the core documentation generation logic. The abstract methods in `BaseAdapter` enforce a consistent interface, ensuring that all adapters provide the necessary functionality. The separation of parsing, prompting, and post-processing into distinct methods promotes modularity and testability.
