# Documentation Generation Adapters: Base Class

This document describes the base adapter interface for documentation generation within the system. It defines the core components and methods required for integrating different language-specific documentation tools. The primary responsibility of these adapters is to bridge the gap between source code files and the large language model (LLM) used for documentation creation.

## Core Concepts

The system employs an adapter pattern to support various programming languages and documentation styles. Each adapter implements a common interface, allowing for flexible extension and maintenance. The key idea is to isolate the language-specific parsing and prompt engineering logic within each adapter, keeping the core documentation generation process language-agnostic.

## BaseAdapter Class

The `BaseAdapter` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the interface for all language-specific adapters. It enforces a consistent structure and ensures that each adapter provides the necessary functionality.

**Attributes:**

This class does not have any attributes.

**Methods:**

*   `can_handle(file_path: Path) -> bool`: This abstract method determines whether the adapter can process a given file based on its path. You must implement this method in each adapter to specify the file types or extensions it supports. It accepts a `Path` object representing the file path and returns `True` if the adapter can handle the file, and `False` otherwise.

*   `parse(file_path: Path, content: str) -> List[str]`: This abstract method parses the content of a source code file and divides it into smaller chunks suitable for processing by the LLM. It takes the file path (`Path`) and the raw file content (`str`) as input. The method should return a list of strings, where each string represents a single chunk of content. The chunking strategy is language-specific and should be designed to optimize LLM performance.

*   `get_prompt(file_path: Path, parsed_content: str) -> str`: This abstract method generates a prompt for the LLM based on the file path and a single chunk of parsed content. It receives the file path (`Path`) and a chunk of parsed content (`str`) as input. The method should return a string that represents the prompt to be sent to the LLM. The prompt should be carefully crafted to instruct the LLM to generate documentation for the given content.

*   `post_process(file_path: Path, outputs: List[str]) -> str`: This method combines the outputs generated by the LLM for each chunk of content into a final documentation string. It takes the file path (`Path`) and a list of LLM outputs (`List[str]`) as input. The default implementation simply joins the outputs with double newlines (`\n\n`). You can override this method in specific adapters to implement more sophisticated post-processing logic, such as formatting or merging.

## Type Hints

The code makes extensive use of type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. For example:

*   `file_path: Path` indicates that the `file_path` parameter should be a `Path` object.
*   `content: str` indicates that the `content` parameter should be a string.
*   `-> bool` indicates that the method returns a boolean value.
*   `-> List[str]` indicates that the method returns a list of strings.

These type hints help to prevent errors and make the code easier to understand.

## Design Decisions

The adapter pattern was chosen to promote modularity and extensibility. This allows us to easily add support for new languages or documentation styles without modifying the core documentation generation logic. The use of abstract methods ensures that all adapters implement the required functionality. The `post_process` method provides a default implementation for combining LLM outputs, but allows for customization in specific adapters.
