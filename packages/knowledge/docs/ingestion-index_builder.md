## Glassops Knowledge Index Builder Documentation

This document details the functionality of the knowledge index builder, a component responsible for creating and maintaining a vector store of knowledge documents using ChromaDB. This vector store enables efficient similarity searches for question answering and knowledge retrieval.

**Module Purpose:**

The primary responsibility of this module is to ingest document embeddings and store them in a ChromaDB collection. It handles the initialization of the ChromaDB client, collection creation (if it doesn’t exist), and the population of the collection with document data and their corresponding vector representations. The module supports updating the index with new or modified documents.

**Key Classes & Roles:**

*   **`chromadb.PersistentClient`:** This class from the ChromaDB library is used to establish a connection to a ChromaDB instance with persistent storage. The `PersistentClient` ensures that the vector store data is saved to disk and available across sessions.
*   **`chromadb.Collection`:** Represents a collection within ChromaDB where document embeddings are stored and managed. We create or retrieve a collection named "glassops_knowledge" to hold our knowledge base.

**Important Functions & Behavior:**

*   **`build_or_update_index(embeddings)`:** This is the core function of the module. It accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a document dictionary and its corresponding embedding vector.
    *   **Input:** `embeddings` – A list of tuples. Each tuple has the structure `(doc_dict, embedding_vector)`. `doc_dict` is expected to have keys "path", "content", and "hash". `embedding_vector` is a numerical representation of the document's content.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Determines the persistence directory for the ChromaDB database ("glassops\_index" within the current working directory).
        2.  Initializes a `chromadb.PersistentClient` to connect to the ChromaDB instance.
        3.  Retrieves an existing collection named "glassops\_knowledge" or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. The collection is configured to use cosine similarity for distance calculations (`metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}`).
        4.  Extracts document IDs, content, metadata, and embedding vectors from the input `embeddings` list. The document "path" is used as the unique identifier for each document. Metadata includes both the document "path" and "hash".
        5.  Uses the `upsert` method of the ChromaDB collection to add or update documents in the vector store.  If a document with the same ID (path) already exists, its embedding and content are updated.
    *   **Output:** None. The function modifies the ChromaDB collection directly. Prints success or error messages to the console.
    *   **Type Hints:** The function uses type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. The `embeddings` parameter is explicitly typed as a list of tuples, specifying the expected structure of the input data.

**Notable Patterns & Design Decisions:**

*   **Persistence:** The use of `chromadb.PersistentClient` ensures that the knowledge index is saved to disk, allowing for persistent storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
*   **ID Strategy:** The document "path" is used as the unique identifier for each document in the ChromaDB collection. This design choice allows for easy updating of documents. If a document with the same path is provided, its content and embedding will be overwritten. The document hash is stored as metadata for verification purposes.
*   **Metadata:**  Storing both the document path and hash as metadata provides additional context and allows for potential data integrity checks.
*   **Error Handling:** The `upsert` operation is wrapped in a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during indexing and provide informative error messages.
*   **Cosine Similarity:** The ChromaDB collection is configured to use cosine similarity, a common metric for measuring the similarity between vector embeddings.
*   **Empty Index Handling:** The function checks if the input `embeddings` list is empty and prints a message if no documents are provided, preventing errors.

**Instructions for Use:**

You need to provide a list of `(doc_dict, embedding_vector)` tuples to the `build_or_update_index` function. Ensure that each `doc_dict` contains the keys "path", "content", and "hash". The embedding vectors should be numerical representations of the document content, generated by a suitable embedding model.
